For 'regular' directory, your parser must parse all .c programs
without an error, and the result must be compared with the corresponding 
.ans programs.
There must not be any diffs (as long as you print your parser tree
with pr_program function in the syntree.c unmodified).
Use run_test script in that directory. 

For 'fuzzying' directory, there are many c??.c files and their
corresponding (slightly modified) w??.c files. Your parser must 
parse all c??.c files without an error, AND must signal an error for
all w??.c files.  Use run_test script in that directory. Note that
some numbers are missing (like c15.c).
